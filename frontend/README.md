# Identity System

**⚠️ This project is currently under active development. Expect frequent updates and changes.**

The Identity System is a user-friendly React-based frontend designed to support the first phase of the AI-powered exam monitoring system. This component focuses on verifying student or individual identities by comparing live images with a stored database of registered individuals.

---

## Features

- **Student Identity Verification:** Matches a student's live image with a registered image stored in the database.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive UI for users to capture live images or upload existing files.
- **Error Handling:** Displays specific error messages when issues arise, such as "No face detected in the image."
- **Data Interaction:** Supports efficient communication with the backend for image processing and comparison.

## Development Steps

1. **Step 1:** Implement image upload and live capture functionalities.
2. **Step 2:** Integrate the frontend with the backend for identity comparison.
3. **Step 3:** Display comparison results with success or error messages.
4. **Step 4:** Enhance UI for a better user experience.

## Error Handling and Feedback

- The application provides real-time error messages such as:
  - "No face detected in the image"
  - "Image upload failed"
- Users receive these alerts through a clean and interactive UI.

### Example:

If no face is detected in the image, the application displays:

```plaintext
Error: No face detected in the image
```

## Future Improvements

- Integrate advanced face detection techniques for better accuracy.
- Support additional biometric methods.
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
- Improve error handling with more descriptive feedback.
